I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Institute of Information Engineering](https://iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://ucas.ac.cn/), under the supervision of Associate Researcher. [Yong Liu](https://iie-liuyong.github.io/) and Researcher Weiping Wang. <br>
I received my Bachelor's degree in [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in Shenyang, China, where I am a member of 2011 International class (English) in Software College. 

# Research
My research interests mainly lie in **efficient large scale machine learning with theoretical guarantee**, but also include kernel methods, semi-supervised learning (SSL) and interpretability of neural networks. <br>
Indeed, my works focus on **generalization** analysis of those areas and building effective and scalable **optimization** tools for them, to channel theory and algorithms into applications.
